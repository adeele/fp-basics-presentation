## Introduction to functional programming

Functional programming treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions.
Programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)

### Paradigm characteristics

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>
        <b>Statelessness</b> - an operation is not sensitive to the state of the computation
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Referential transparency</b> - an expression can be replaced with its corresponding value without changing the
        program's behavior
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Immutability</b> - an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created
    </li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

### Comparison to imperative programming

<Split>
<div>

Imperative
```js
const sum = (list) => {
    let result = 0;
    for (element of list) {
        result += element;
    }
    return result;
}
```

</div>
<div>

Declarative
```js
const sum = (list) => {
    const add = ((x, y) => x + y);
    return list.reduce(add, 0);
}
```

</div>
</Split>
